## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **Three.js**: 3D graphics library
- **WebGL**: Hardware-accelerated 3D rendering
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Rendering surface
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks, pure JS implementation

### Performance Optimizations
- **Adaptive Quality**: Automatically adjusts rendering quality based on device performance
- **Efficient Geometry**: Optimized 3D models for smooth performance
- **Smart Culling**: Only renders visible objects
- **Mobile Optimizations**: Reduced complexity for mobile devices
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and resource management

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+
- Mobile browsers with WebGL support

## üì± Mobile Support

The simulation is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices:
- Touch-friendly controls
- Adaptive UI layout
- Performance optimizations for mobile hardware
- Reduced visual complexity on low-end devices

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Planets
To add new celestial bodies, modify the `planetData` array in `script.js`:

```javascript
{
    name: 'Pluto',
    radius: 0.2,
    distance: 180,
    speed: 0.4,
    rotationSpeed: 0.02,
    color: 0x8c7853,
    info: 'Former ninth planet, now classified as a dwarf planet.',
    realDistance: '5.9 billion km',
    realPeriod: '248 years'
}
```

### Modifying Visual Effects
- Edit materials in the `createPlanet()` method
- Adjust lighting in the `setupLighting()` method
- Modify particle effects in the `createStarField()` method

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Black screen**: Check browser WebGL support
2. **Poor performance**: Try disabling trails and reducing quality
3. **Controls not working**: Ensure JavaScript is enabled
4. **Mobile issues**: Try landscape orientation for better experience

### Performance Tips
- Close other browser tabs
- Use hardware acceleration if available
- Reduce browser zoom level
- Disable trails on slower devices
